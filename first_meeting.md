## First Meeting

One of the most important meetings a mentor will have with a mentee is their first meeting. Mentoring is not only about learning how to code but understanding your mentee's motivations and goals. This usually means asking a lot of questions and listening.

1. What inspired you to learn how to code?

   _I'm looking for their motivations._

2. In an ideal world, what kind of coding position would you want? In office or remote?

   _It's harder to secure a remote junior position._

3. Tell me about your working career so far.

   _This helps me think of what industry or positions they would be suited for._

4. What does your typical week look like? When will you be coding? Night? Day? Weekend?

   _When will they be contacting me for help or feedback?_

5. Do you tend to be more of a visual or text learner?

   _Will they want to watch the videos or will they prefer reading the curriculum?_  

6. From the coding exercises you have done so far, what did you think?

   _What languages did they gel with?_
