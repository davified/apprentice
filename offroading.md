## Offroading

Based on a students interests, abilities, and company they want to work for, I will "extras" into their assignments so they will become a more well rounded developer.

### Devops

After they have deployed to Heroku for the first time, I request they handle all subsequent app deployments on a bare server (Digital Ocean or Amazon Web Services).

Deployment guides:

[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-ruby-on-rails-one-click-application-on-digitalocean)

[Amazon Web Services](https://www.sitepoint.com/deploy-your-rails-app-to-aws/)

## Development Database

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It's great for developing locally but is not ideal for hosting databases in production. After my mentees have completed their Rails project, I have them start developing locally with a production level database, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

### Continuous Integration

After my students have completed their first solo project and they start submitting pull requests to me, I ask they set up free opensource CI on their projects.

My recommendations:

* [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org)
* [Codeship](https://codeship.com)
