## Case Study Project

As my mentees work towards their portfolio, I encourage them to create an application that they want to create. During a Bloc.io course, this is called the Capstone Project.

I ask that they build an app that they

* Would want to use
* Have domain expertise in
* An idea that they've experienced missing from the market
* Above all, has a great story to tell in an interview or lightning talk

I ask them create to a Google Doc so we can pair on the project requirements with the following template:

****************

__Name of the Application__

_Short descriptive name_

__App Availability__

_Is this meant for desktop or mobile? Where will you host it?_

__App User__

_Describe the typical users and the market for the app. Is this for a real market or do you hope to create a market for it?_

__Domain Expertise__

_Why are you a good choice for building this app? Is there a story?_

__Planned Technologies__

* ROR
* Postgres
* Rspec
* Bootstrap

__Third Party Applications__

__User Stories for Phase 1 of Capstone__

_Example: As a user I want to:
I want to be able to sign in, sign up, and sign out_

__User Stories for Phase 2 of Capstone__

__User Stories for Phase 3 of Capstone__

__Competitor Apps for Inspiration__

__Data Population__

I recommend [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for a rapid wireframing tool.
